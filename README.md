# santa-game

This is my first attempt at making a game. You play as santa claus, and you have to drop presents into the chimneys as you fly over them.

## Possible features

Cannon shoots presents as mouse rotates around

Flying objects?

Homing missiles?

Death/lives

Santa rotates slightly as he moves up or downwards

Collectibles: Milk & Cookies (replenish health/lives), candycanes

Obstacles: Birds


## Roadmap

1. Add chimney art
2. Have end to game: santa can die from hitting stuff - he has x lives
3. Add something that does damage
4. Add Health
5. Add end game screen showing score & restart. Score = presents scored and distance travelled, so wehen game ends you see your high score.
6. Add reindeer?
