# santa-game

This is my first attempt at making a game. You play as santa claus, and you have to drop presents into the chimneys as you fly over them.

## Possible features

Cannon shoots presents as mouse rotates around

Flying objects?

Homing missiles?

Death/lives

Santa rotates slightly as he moves up or downwards

Collectibles: Milk & Cookies (replenish health/lives), candycanes

Obstacles: Birds


## Roadmap

1. Add chimney art -done
2. Have end to game: santa can die from hitting stuff - he has x lives
3. Add something that does damage - done
4. Add Health - done
5. Add end game screen showing score & restart. 
6. Score = presents scored and distance travelled, so wehen game ends you see your high score - done
7. Add reindeer?
8. Save data - High score, datetime, (3 digit) name?, always sorted in order of highest score 

Add different typess of enemies:
    Random vertical movement
    Slow movement (current ducks) horizontally - no vertical movement
    One that chases you a bit but can be outrun. You can go past it and it will no longer chase you
    Something guaranteed to hit you but that will do a bit of damage when it does so you either have to kill it with a present or just have enough health
    
Be able to kill ducks/enemies with presents

Health items and/or buffs/powerups

Add aiming system
    Add powewrups so you can fire multiple things
        double ended canon
        multishot
        machinegun?
