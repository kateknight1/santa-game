# santa-game

This is my first attempt at making a game. You play as santa claus, and you have to drop presents into the chimneys as you fly over them.

## Planned features

Add some randomness to how presents hit chimneys
Cannon shoots presents as mouse rotates around
Flying objects?
Homing missiles?
Death/lives
Santa rotates slightly as he moves up or downwards
